    This function looks at dict items with known keys.

    This function is recursive over dicts and lists.
    Current implementation performs re-arranging in-place (to save memory),
    so it is not required to store the return value.

    The intended usage is for composite objects which contain
    OrderedDict elements. The implementation makes sure that ordering
    (dictated by keys) is preserved. Support for generic dicts is an added value.

    Sadly, dict (at least in Python 2.7) does not have __updatevalue__(key) method
    which would guarantee iteritems() is not affected when value is updated.
    Current "obj[key] = value" implementation is safe for dict and OrderedDict,
