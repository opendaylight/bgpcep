/**
 * Implementation of the BGP import policy. Listens on all Adj-RIB-In, inspects all inbound
 * routes in the context of the advertising peer's role and applies the inbound policy.
 *
 * Inbound policy is applied as follows:
 *
 * 1) if the peer is an eBGP peer, perform attribute replacement and filtering
 * 2) check if a route is admissible based on attributes attached to it, as well as the
 *    advertising peer's role
 * 3) output admissing routes with edited attributes into /bgp-rib/rib/peer/effective-rib-in/tables/routes
 *
 * Note that we maintain the peer roles using a DCL, even if we could look up our internal
 * structures. This is done so we maintain causality and loose coupling.
