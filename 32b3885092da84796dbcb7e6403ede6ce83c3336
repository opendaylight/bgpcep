      "message": "Hum... I didn\u0027t really understand your comment. I split the migration of stateful and initiated RFC in 2 steps:\n- First, migrate yang models to api bundle (this is the previous patch you already merged)\n- Second, migrate the parser for new Stateful and Initiated TLVs, Objects and Messages to base-parser bundle.\n\nWhat are you expected from me? Update the commit message? split this patch in 2 parts: one for Stateful and then another one for Initiated while the previous migrate both yang models?\n\nThanks for your help and advices\n\nOlivier",
