We have exactly the same declaration for the TLV \n\"\n    // TLVs\n    grouping tlv {\n        description \"Marker grouping for TLV groupings.\";\n    }\n\"\nThis allows to mark all TLVs declaration inherit to the TLV interface to ease parser / serializer. I understand that we need the same for the message.\n\nIf I understand right, your \"message-type\" proposal within notification will no more need this declaration. Can you confirm?",

That should provide a guide to what the object/tlv story will look like.\n\nThe thing is: we could say that a message is comprised of some fixed things and a list of objects and objects are comprised of some common things and a list of tlvs -- that is the on-wire format. But that would kind of defeat us wanting to have actual shapes of particular messages so users can say \u0027this is an Open message, so give me its OPEN object\u0027.",
