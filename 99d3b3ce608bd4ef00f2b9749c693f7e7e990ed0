      "message": "So, the patch solved the problem, but introduce a smallest one.\n\nOnce deployed the new bgpcep, as previously, you must restart karaf in order to change the bgp configuration that are stored in etc/opendatlight/bgpcep/protocol-config.xml (if you only used the REST API to change the configuration, after a restart the configuration stored in the config file is applied again and modification from rest API lost). But, once  you add a new peer with the REST API, BGP peer is created but BGP session is not started. You need to restart karaf again to get the BGP session up and running.\n\nI could provide new complete log if needed.",
