PEP8 is Python coding standard.
http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

This code is not fully following PEP8, we do not enforce/follow the following :
	W191 - use space for indentation

         I like three space for tabs, others like their code less compact, tabs are just great for that

  E101 - indentation using mix of tabs and space

         Obviously MUST be followed ... but ONE case : when aligning paramenters data over multiple lines.
         The extra line should start with tabs to the point of indentation and finish with space, so the 
         alignment does not change when tabs spaces are changes (from 1 to 8 for example)

  E201 - whitespace after '{'
  E202 - whitespace before ')'
  E203 - whitespace before ','
  E211 - whitespace before '('
  E225 - missing whitespace around operator
  E231 - E231 missing whitespace after ','

         Function should be defined as :
         def foo (param1, param2, param3):
         and used calling
         foo(param1,param2,param3)

         This makes search of function definition vs call must easier
         This makes the reading of the function interface easier as well

         list can be clearer when defined as :
         mylist = [ element1 , element2 , element3 ]

  E221 - multiple spaces before operator
  E272 - for extraneous whitespace around keywords

         Sometimes it can make the code more readable to have aligned operation :
           mostly if they are on the same line of a single if test


  E302 - blank lines
  E303 - blank lines

         This rule is too rigid, if two class are related, one blank can convey the idea
         Three blank can be used to separate code more visibly

  E501 - line too long

         This is a good coding practice but warning messages to users violate that rule so ignored
         in the file with long strings

  E701 - multiple statements on one line

         As python does not have switch, multiple if lines with only a one action are visually pleasing
