      "message": "Hello Robert,\n\nHere it is a patch to enhance BGP-LS with latest RFCs. It is huge, but it was very difficult to split it due to the fact that I must perform a major revision of bgp-linkstate and bgp-semgent-ruouting yang model. I hope you could review it. Don\u0027t hesitate to contact me for any clarification.\n\nI wish you a merry Christmas and happy new year.\n\nOlivier",

      "message": "Hi Robert, Ivan,\n\nI just update my patch regarding Flex Algo. I assume in a first approach that there is only one Flex Algo Definition TLV per node while the RFC mention \"one or more\". So, I change for a list of Flex Algo Definition (FAD) instead of a single FAD TLV.\n\nRegards\n\nOlivier",
