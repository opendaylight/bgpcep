/**
 * Swiss army knife equivalent for reconnect strategies.
 * 
 * This strategy continues to schedule reconnect attempts, each having to
 * complete in a fixed time (connectTime).
 * 
 * Initial sleep time is specified as minSleep. Each subsequent unsuccessful
 * attempt multiplies this time by a constant factor (sleepFactor) -- this
 * allows for either constant reconnect times (sleepFactor = 1), or various
 * degrees of exponential back-off (sleepFactor > 1). Maximum sleep time
 * between attempts can be capped to a specific value (maxSleep).
 * 
 * The strategy can optionally give up based on two criteria:
 * 
 * A preset number of connection retries (maxAttempts) has been reached, or
 * 
 * A preset absolute deadline is reached (deadline nanoseconds, as reported
 * by System.nanoTime(). In this specific case, both connectTime and maxSleep
 * will be controlled such that the connection attempt is resolved as closely
 * to the deadline as possible.
 * 
 * Both these caps can be combined, with the strategy giving up as soon as the
 * first one is reached.
