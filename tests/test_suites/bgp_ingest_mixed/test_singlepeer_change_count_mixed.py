# BGP performance of ingesting from 1 iBGP peer, data change counter
# is used. This suite uses play.py as single iBGP peer. The suite
# only looks at example-ipv4-topology, so RIB is not examined.
# This suite requires odl-bgpcep-data-change-counter to be installed
# so make sure it is added to "install-features" of any jobs
# that are going to invoke it.The suite consists of two halves,
# differing on which side initiates BGP connection.
# Data change counter is a lightweight way to detect
# "work is being done". change_counter.py provide a nice function
# to wait for stability, but it needs initial value, that is why
# "TestSinglePeerChangeCount.last_change_count_single = change_counter.get_change_count()"
# appears just before work-inducing action. The time for
# test_wait_for_stable_* cases to finish is the main performance
# metric.After waiting for stability is done, full check on
# number of prefixes present is performed.
