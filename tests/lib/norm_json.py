    Current implementation performs re-arranging in-place (to save memory),

    The intended usage is for composite objects which contain
    OrderedDict elements. The implementation makes sure that ordering
    (dictated by keys) is preserved. Support for generic dicts is an added value.

    which would guarantee iteritems() is not affected when value is updated.
    Current "obj[key] = value" implementation is safe for dict and OrderedDict,
