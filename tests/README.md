# CSIT - Continuous System Integration Test

## Overview
This directory contains **Continuous System Integration Tests (CSIT)** and associated testing tools
for the **BGPCEP** project. Test are written using common python testing framework, PyTest. These tests are used to test
the core **BGP** and **PCEP** functionality of Opendaylight distribution. These tests are run directly against
built opendaylight distribution with its associated test tools without relying on any external repository with prebuilt artifacts
like nexus.

## Test File Origin and History
Test data files and test tools scripts contained in this repository were originally created as part of separate
testing project which used Robot Framework library for system testing. Now as part of moving to more
lightweight and simpler PyTest framework part of the original test files were reused.

## Directory Structure
The main directory structure is as following:

| Directory       | Description                                                                                                                |
|:----------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `allure-result` | Directory used for storing Allure reports generated during test runs.                                                      |
| `libraries`     | Directory containing reusable test functions used in test cases.                                                           |
| `results`       | Directory used for storing test results (e.g., logs, performance metrics).                                                 |
| `suites`        | Directory containing test suites.                                                                                          |
| `tmp`           | Directory containing temporary files used during test execution, but are cleared at the start of the test run.             |
| `tools`         | Directory containing custom test tools for simulating BGP peers or tools used for rapid updating of LSPs through RESTCONF. |
| `variables`     | Directory containing test data (mostly templates used for RESTCONF calls).                                                 |

## Test Execution
Tests can be executed using two primary methods:

### 1. Part of maven build
Test can be run directly during maven build using `integration-tests` profile
```sh
mvn clean install -Pintegration-tests
```
### 2. Using tox command
Tests can be also run separately using tox tool which needs to be invoked from tests directory by running commands such as:
```sh
cd tests
tox -e pytest
```
### Test results
Test results are evaluated using allure reporting system. To view the generated test report run the following command:
```sh
allure serve tests/allure-results/
```
