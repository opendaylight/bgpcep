    # Gitlint only proposes a pre-commit configuration for the commit-msg stage but none for the commit stage.
    # Its default arguments --passed and --msg-filename are different from CI recommandations.
    # As a result, the line above is always skipped in jenkins CI since there cannot be a .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG file.
    # A dedicated gitlint profile for CI is proposed below. Also to behave fine locally, this profile must have access
    # to the HOME variable so that Gitlint can retrieve Git user settings.
