Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install feature - ``features-algo``. Also, for the sake of this sample, it is
required to install RESTCONF in order to use the Path Computation service.

In the Karaf console, type command:

.. code-block:: console

    feature:install features-restconf features-algo


Yang Model
^^^^^^^^^^

Path Computation algorithm used Graph plugin, thus graph API and yang models.
A new yang model has been introduced in order to define constrained path model
as well as a new RPC service to call Path Computation Algorithm plugin.
The model is given below:

.. code-block:: console

      module: path-computation
      +--rw constrained-path
         +--rw metric?             uint32
         +--rw te-metric?          uint32
         +--rw delay?              gr:delay
         +--rw jitter?             gr:delay
         +--rw loss?               gr:loss
         +--rw admin-group?        uint32
         +--rw address-family?     enumeration
         +--rw class-type?         uint8
         +--rw bandwidth?          gr:decimal-bandwidth
         +--rw source?             uint64
         +--rw destination?        uint64
         +--rw path-description* []
         |  +--rw ipv4?    inet:ipv4-address
         |  +--rw ipv6?    inet:ipv6-address
         |  +--rw label?   netc:mpls-label
         +--rw status?             computation-status

               +--ro computed-delay?       gr:delay


REST API
^^^^^^^^

This section details how to use the Path Computation Service RPC that could be
used to request a path computation from a source to a destination with given
constraints over a given graph.

Get Constrained Path
''''''''''''''''''''

Path Computation algorithms are accessible through the RPC described below:

-----

**URL:** ``restconf/operations/path-computation:get-constrained-path``

**Method:** ``POST``

**Content-Type:** ``application/json``

**Request Body:**

.. code-block:: json
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 3,4,5,6,12

      {
         "input": {
            "graph-name": "example",
            "source": 9,
            "destination": 4,
            "constraints": {
               "address-family": "ipv4",
               "te-metric": 250,
               "bandwidth": 100000000,
               "class-type": 0
            },
            "algorithm": "cspf"
         }
      }

@line 3: **graph-name** The *name* of the graph that must exist.

@line 4: **source** The *source* as vertex ID in the graph.

@line 5: **destination** - The *destination* as vertex ID in the graph.

@line 6: **constraints** - List of *Constraints*. Possible values are:

* *address-family* (ipv4, ipv6, sr-ipv4 and sr-ipv6) - default ipv4
* *te-metric* as integer value
* *bandwidth* (byte/sec) as integer value
* *class-type* for the bandwidth - default 0
* *delay* (micro-second) as integer value

@line 12: **algorithm** - *Type of Path Computation Algorithm* Valid options
are ``spf``, ``cspf`` and ``samcra`` - default ``spf``.

**Response Body:**

.. code-block:: json
   :linenos:

      {
         "output": {
            "computed-metric": 210,
            "status": "completed",
            "path-description": [
                  {
                     "ipv4": "10.194.77.143"
                  },
                  {
                     "ipv4": "10.194.77.155"
                  },
                  {
                     "ipv4": "10.194.77.161"
                  }
            ]
         }
      }


Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Debug message could be activated with:

.. code-block:: console

    log:set DEBUG org.opendaylight.algo

Then check log with ``log:tail`` command.

In particular, if answer is ``failed`` check that source and destination
vertices are known in the graph and that constraints are not too huge.
A good advice is to start first by relaxing some constraints to see if
algorithm could find a valid path or not, and then re-enable constraints
one by one to find which one could not be met. Logs will also provide
information about constraints that are not met during the path computation.
